# First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking is a fancy way of saying "think like a physicist." Rather than reasoning by analogy, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and then you reason up from there.

Reasoning by analogy is like building a house by looking at other houses. First principles is looking at the raw materials and asking what is physically possible.

## The Elon Musk Approach

Musk used this to build SpaceX. Everyone said rockets were too expensive. He looked at the raw material cost of aluminum, titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. It turned out the materials were only 2% of a typical rocket price.

### The Code

```javascript
function reason(problem) {
  const truths = breakDown(problem);
  const solution = reconstruct(truths);
  return solution;
}
```
